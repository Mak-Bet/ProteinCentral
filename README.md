# Internship-project-lek
Tessellation-derived graph centrality measures for analyzing structures of protein-protein complexes.
The main questions to be answered during the project are the following ones:

Do tessellation graph-based centralities differ significantly from distance graph-based centralities?

Are tessellation graph-based centralities more useful for predicting protein structural hot-spots?
